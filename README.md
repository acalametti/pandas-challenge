Module 4 Homework

Contributor: Alex Calametti

Overview: 
For this assignment data from a school district was analyzed and represented in a variety of data frames using pandas in Jupyter Notebook. Data from two CSV files (schools_complete and students_complete) were merged to create a single data source. The starter code provided was used as a guide to complete the assignment. Once the analysis was done a summary was included at the top of the notebook. For this project, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook need to be installed on your device. All the data and starter code provided can be found in the Resources or starter code folders. 

Part 1: 
For the first part of this project data from all the schools in an individual district was analyzed and summarized using pandas commands and calculations. Once district-wide data was established, the groupby function was used to isolate individual schools based on the number of students, school type, budget, math and reading scores, per capita spending on students, and the percentage of students passing. All of this information was then summarized in a data frame and also includes the best and worst-performing schools and a breakdown based on each school year.

Part 2: 
The second portion of this project focuses on comparing the schools using bins for different categories using the pd.cut function. These categories included scores by school spending and score by school size, both of which are shown in their respective data frames. 

Big thanks to my tutor Geronimo Perez for helping me get started on this assignment and showing me a great shortcut when doing the groupby command. Also shoutout to learning assistants Garret and Rowan for helping me troubleshoot my code with me when I ran into issues.
